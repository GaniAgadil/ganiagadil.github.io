This is a link to my website : https://ganiagadil.github.io


The main problem for this assignment was preparing all components to run rmarkdown::render_site(). Running the code several times did not provide any results. I noticed there were only mistakes related to the formats of the files. I used the correct path and right formats of the files and problem solved.
It seems to me that using this website has a wide range of applications. First of all, I will probably use the website to collaborative work which might involve specific analytical and research-oriented projects. In addition, it is useful to have a webpage that allows to modify the information independently and provide the outcome of the projects to discuss an important aspects of the problem.
